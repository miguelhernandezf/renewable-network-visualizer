- Designed a 3-layer neural network architecture
- Implemented forward propagation with sigmoid activation
- Added feature importance calculation
- Created energy type recommendation logic

### 3. Network Visualization
- Created SVG-based visualization of neural network
- Implemented connection animation
- Added hover effects for weight display

### 4. Recommendation Panel
- Displayed energy type recommendations
- Implemented feature importance visualization
- Added detailed calculation steps

## Key Prompts Used

### Initial Project Setup
```
Create a React application for renewable energy optimization that uses a neural network to predict optimal placement of solar panels or wind turbines based on environmental factors.
```

### Network Architecture
```
Design a neural network model with 7 input nodes (latitude, longitude, sunlight hours, wind speed, temperature range, elevation, water proximity), 5 hidden nodes, and 1 output node.
```

### Data Input Panel
```
Create a component with input fields for latitude, longitude, sunlight hours, wind speed, temperature range, elevation, and water proximity. Include preset location scenarios.
```

### Visualization
```
Create an SVG-based visualization of the neural network that shows nodes, connections, and weights. Add animation for forward propagation.
```

### Recommendation Logic
```
Implement logic to determine optimal energy type (Solar/Wind) based on network output. Include confidence scores and feature importance.
```

### Error Handling
```
Add proper error handling for null values and undefined properties in the recommendation panel and network visualization.
```

### UI/UX Improvements
```
Enhance the user interface with Material-UI components and add animations for network visualization.
```

## Implementation Details

### Network Weights and Biases
```
Initialize weights with random values between -1 and 1. Use biases for hidden and output layers.
```

### Normalization
```
Normalize input values to a 0-1 range based on their respective maximum values (e.g., latitude: -90 to 90, sunlight hours: 0 to 12).
```

### Feature Importance
```
Calculate feature importance based on absolute values of input-to-hidden connection weights.
```

### Energy Type Recommendation
```
If network output > 0.7 recommend Solar, otherwise recommend Wind. Show confidence scores and reasoning.
```
