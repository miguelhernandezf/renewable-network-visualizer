We had never used an AI tool like Windsurf or Cursor that directly manages project files and code. It was a very useful and enriching experience. Some members of our group were already familiar with JavaScript and React, so we could clearly see how fast and efficient AI can be when building applications. It helped us generate components, structure the project, and even debug some parts with much less effort than coding everything manually.

However, using AI wasn't without its challenges. Sometimes, the AI didnâ€™t fully understand what we needed, so we had to rephrase or try different prompts to get the correct output. We also had to manually review and fix small errors or adjust the code to meet our specific needs. Compared to traditional coding, AI made the process faster and less stressful, especially for repetitive tasks, but it still required our guidance and understanding of how things should work. Overall, it was a powerful tool that supported and enhanced our development experience.
